/**
 * 554. Brick Wall
 * 
 * There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the
 * same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least 
 * bricks.
 *
 * The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each 
 * brick in this row from left to right.
 *
 * If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how
 * to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.
 *
 * You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously
 * cross no bricks.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [[1,2,2,1],
 *         [3,1,2],
 *         [1,3,2],
 *         [2,4],
 *         [3,1,2],
 *         [1,3,1,1]]
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Explanation: 
 *
 * Find image in LC554.png in documentation
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
 * The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number 
 * of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

    /**
     * This is pretty simple problem but need to think smart
     * 
     * Lets understand with bricks with two rows as per below. 
     * 
     * --|-|---
     * -|--|---
     * 
     * Pipes are the gep between two brick, Here if we draw line between 2nd pipe in both row then output will be 0
     * 
     * How we will identify the gaps. 
     * we make use of a HashMap
     * map which is used to store entries in the form:
     * (sum,count). Here,
     * sum refers to the cumulative sum of the bricks' widths encountered in the current row, and
     * count refers to the number of times the corresponding sum is obtained. Thus,
     * sum in a way, represents the positions of the bricks's boundaries relative to the leftmost boundary.
     *
     * This is done based on the following observation:
     * We will never obtain the same value of sum twice while traversing over a particular row.
     * Thus, if the sum value is repeated while traversing over the rows, it means some row's brick boundary coincides with some previous row's brick boundary.
     * This fact is accounted for by incrementing the corresponding count value.
     * But, for every row, we consider the sum only upto the second last brick, since the last boundary isn't a valid boundary for the solution. 
     * 
     * 
     * HERE WE WILL TAKE SUM and COUNT Map 
     * 
     * SUM will tell us at which location we will get edge and how many edges will get for any perticular sum. 
     * 
     * Lets say SUM = 2 comes 3 times. It means there are three edges that we found, 
     * So in above condition  line will not cross at least 3 edges, 
     * so remaing line will cross SIZE_OF_WALL_ROW - 3 edges = RESULT
     *
