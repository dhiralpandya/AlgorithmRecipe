/**
 * All the problems  available in this package are solved with (sum-k) kind of algorithms.
 * What is sum-k ?
 * k is a target and sum is a current sum in iteration,
 * Normally we are using sum-k to reach to the actual previous index which has
 * previously calculated sum value equal to (sum-k)
 *
 * It is little difficult to explain with words but best way to understand this to look for simple
 * problem : GFGFindPairForSum, it is easy problem that we have solved it with this algorithm. s
