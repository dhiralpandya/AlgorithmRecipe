/**
 * 636. Exclusive Time of Functions
 * On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between 0 and N-1.
 * <p>
 * We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
 * <p>
 * Each log is a string with this format: "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}".  For example, "0:start:3"
 * means the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3.  "1:end:2" means the function with id 1
 * ended at the end of timestamp 2.
 * <p>
 * A function's exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does not
 * include any recursive calls to child functions.
 * <p>
 * The CPU is single threaded which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
 * <p>
 * Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * n = 2
 * logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * Explanation:
 * Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
 * Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
 * Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1
 * unit of time.
 * So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
 * Functions will always log when they exit.

    /**
     * Before starting off with the solution,
     * let's discuss a simple idea.
     * Suppose we have three functions func_1func func_2func and func_3func
     * such that func_1func calls func_2func   and then func_2func calls func_3func  .
     * In this case, func_3func  starts at the end and ends first, func_2func  starts at 2nd position and ends at the 2nd last step.
     * Similarly, func_1func   starts first and ends at the last position.
     * Thus, we can conclude that the function which is entered at the end finishes first and the one which is entered first ends at the last position.
