/**
 * 477. Total Hamming Distance
 * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
 *
 * Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: 4, 14, 2
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
 * showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
 * HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
 * Note:
 * Elements of the given array are in the range of 0 to 10^9
 * Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.

    /**
     * Here we only have 0 or 1, It means at each position 
     * which has different digits can be calculate : NumberOfOnes * NumberOfZeros at each position
     * 
     * Example :
     * Lets say we have 5 integers [2,2,2,0,0]
     * Binary for above 5 integers are [10,10,10,00,00]
     *  
     * Not at position ZERO[0] all integer has 0, Means we have Five 0 and Zero 1 
     * So total of different digits at position zero is Sum = 5[Zeros] * 0[Ones] = 0
     * 
     * Now lets move to position One. We have Three 0 and Two 1. 
     * So total of different digits at position one is Sum = 3[Zero] * 2[One] = 6 (Here each 1 will get two 0, So total we have 3 ones means 6 combination)
     *
