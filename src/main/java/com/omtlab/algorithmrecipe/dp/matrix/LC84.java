/**
 * 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
 * 
 * Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the 
 * area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
 *
 *
 * Documentation/LC84Img1.png
 *
 * Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
 *
 *
 * Documentation/LC84Img2.png
 *
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
 * Output: 10
