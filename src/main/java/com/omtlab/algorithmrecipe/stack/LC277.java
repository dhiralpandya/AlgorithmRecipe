/**
 * 277. Find the Celebrity
 *
 * Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity.
 * The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
 * Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one.
 * The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B.
 * You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 * You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.
 *
 * Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
