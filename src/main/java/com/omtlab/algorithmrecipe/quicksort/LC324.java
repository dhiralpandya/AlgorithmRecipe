/**
 * 324. Wiggle Sort II
 * 
 * 
 * Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
 * Output: One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
 * Output: One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].
 * Note:
 * You may assume all input has valid answer.
 *
 * Follow Up:
 * Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

     * The virtual index idea in the post https://leetcode.com/discuss/77133/o-n-o-1-after-median-virtual-indexing
     * is very brilliant! However, it takes me a while to understand why and how it works. There is no 'nth_element' 
     * in Java, but you can use 'findKthLargest' function from "https://leetcode
     * .com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/" to get the median element in average O(n) time and O(1) space.
     *
     * Assume your original array is {6,13,5,4,5,2}. After you get median element, the 'nums' is partially sorted 
     * such that the first half is larger or equal to the median, the second half is smaller or equal to the median, i.e
     *
     * 13   6   5   5   4   2
     *
     *          M
     * In the post https://leetcode.com/discuss/76965/3-lines-python-with-explanation-proof, we have learned that , 
     * to get wiggle sort, you want to put the number in the following way such that
     *
     * (1) elements smaller than the 'median' are put into the last even slots
     *
     * (2) elements larger than the 'median' are put into the first odd slots
     *
     * (3) the medians are put into the remaining slots.
     *
     * Index :       0   1   2   3   4   5
     * Small half:   M       S       S    
     * Large half:       L       L       M
     * M - Median, S-Small, L-Large. 
     * In this example, we want to put {13, 6, 5} in index 1,3,5 and {5,4,2} in index {0,2,4}
