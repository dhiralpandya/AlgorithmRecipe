/**
 * 773. Sliding Puzzle
 * 
 * On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.
 *
 * A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.
 *
 * The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].
 *
 * Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is
 * impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
 * 
 * Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
 * 
 * Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
 * An example path:
 * After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
 * After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
 * After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
 * After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
 * After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
 * After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
 * Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
 * Output: 14
 * Note:
 *
 * board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
 * board[i][j] will be a permutation of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
