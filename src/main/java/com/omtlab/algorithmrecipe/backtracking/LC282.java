/**
 * Solution
 * Approach 1: Backtracking
 * Intuition
 *
 * Let us first look at what the question asks us to do before getting at the approach to solve it. So, we are given 
 * a string of numbers and 3 different operators:
 *
 * + Addition,
 * - Subtraction or
 * * Multiplication
 * We have to find all possible combinations of binary operators between the digits so that the overall value of the 
 * resulting expression becomes equal to a given target value. Let us look at a few possibilities of what it means 
 * exactly to place the operators between digits so that the question becomes clearer.
 *
 * Let's say we are given the following set of digits "123456789" and the target value given to us is 45. Let us see 
 * some of the possible resulting expressions that we can get by placing the operators in different locations.
 *
 * 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
 * 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 - 7 + 8 - 9 = -3
 * 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 - 7 * 8 - 9 = -51
 * 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 - 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 45
 * These are just 4 of the many resulting expressions that are possible by using the given string of digits and the 
 * three operators.
 *
 * By looking at the above examples we can't really figure out any specific pattern among the resulting expressions 
 * that tells us which of them will give us the resulting target.
 *
 * Since the question explicitly states that we are given binary operators, this means that each of the operator 
 * would require two operands.
 *
 * We can consider each of our digits as an operand.
 *
 * This means that between every pair of digits we can have any of the three operators i.e. ++, -− or \times×.
 *
 * If you've looked at the question's statement and the examples that are given in the question, you would realize 
 * that there is an example where the digits are "105" and the target value is 5. For this particular example, there 
 * are two expressions given to us and they are 1*0+5 and 10-5.
 *
 * The second expression is something that you need to look out for before getting to solve this question because 
 * this complicates things a bit.
 *
 * It would have been an easier question to solve if we just had to consider those expressions that simply had digits
 * as operands.
 *
 * But, in this question, we can have all sorts of digits getting together and forming a bigger number that becomes a
 * part of the expression. Let us look at some example expressions for the digits "123456" and target 30.
 *
 * 1 * 23 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 30
 * 12 - 3 * 4 + 5 * 6 = 30
 * 1 - 23 - 4 + 56 = 30
 * So this means that although the number of operators are defined for us i.e. 3 different binary operators, but the 
 * number of operands are not really well defined for us.
 *
 * This is a big portion of the original problem that we need to address in our solution.
 *
 * Since we are asked to find out all of the valid expressions whose value equals the given target and we don't 
 * really know what specific operator between two operands would eventually give us a valid expression,
 *
 * We try out all of the options.
 *
 * This means once we have defined what the operands are for our given expression, we would have three possible 
 * choices of operators between each consecutive pair of operands.
 *
 * From an implementation perspective, what would an operand imply with respect to our original string?
 *
 * An operand would be an integer formed from a substring of our original string.
 *
 * Let's look at two different array partitions for the given string "123456789"
 *
 *
 * Since we are required to return all of the valid expressions that evaluate to a given target value, we have to try
 * all possible partitions of the given array thereby considering all of the possible operands that can be formed 
 * from the digits.
 *
 * There is a very simple way of incorporating this into our algorithm. Right now, at every point in the algorithm, 
 * we have three different choices corresponding to the three different operators.
 *
 * The way we incorporate these partitions is by considering a 4th operator as well which simply moves one step 
 * forward and extends the current operand by one digit. Essentially, going from 12 --> 123 is a NO OP operand in our
 * implementation. (12 * 10) + 3.
 *
 * Now we have 4 different recursion paths in our algorithm and we have to try out all of them to see which ones lead
 * to a potential solution.
 *
 * This try out everything hints at a backtracking solution and that is exactly what we are going to look at here.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *
 * Let's quickly look at the steps involved in our backtracking algorithm before looking at the pseudo-code.
 *
 * As discussed above, we have multiple choices of what operators to use and what the operands can be and hence, we 
 * have to look at all the possibilities to find all valid expressions.
 * Our recursive call will have an index which represents the current digit we're looking at in the original nums 
 * string and also the expression string built till now.
 * At every step, we have exactly 4 different recursive calls. The NO OP call simply extends the current_operand by 
 * the current digit and moves ahead. Rest of the recursive calls correspond to +, -, and *.
 * We keep on building our expression like this and eventually, the entire nums string would be processed. At that 
 * time we check if the expression we built till now is a valid expression or not and we record it if it is a valid one.
 * 1. procedure recurse(digits, index, expression):
 * 2.     if we have reached the end of the string:
 * 3.         if the expression evaluates to the target:
 * 4.             Valid Expression found!
 * 5.     else:
 * 6.         try out operator 'NO OP' and recurse
 * 7.         try out operator * and recurse
 * 8.         try out operator + and recurse
 * 9.         try out operator - and recurse
 * The algorithm now looks pretty straightforward. However, the implementation is something that needs more thought 
 * and there are some things that we need to address before actually looking at the implementation.
 *
 * When we are done building an expression out of all of the digits in our original string i.e. the base case, then 
 * we check if the expression is a valid expression or not. Right ?
 *
 * How do we actually check if an expression is a valid one or not if all we have is a string representing the 
 * expression and not the integer value for the same?
 *
 * Well, one way to go about this is to write a custom eval function that takes in a string and returns the value of 
 * that expression. If you do that (Python people can use the inbuilt function eval for this), you will get a TLE i.e
 * . time limit exceeded error.
 *
 *
 * Can't we keep track of the expression's value on the fly?
 *
 * Well yes. That's the idea we will go with. Instead of just keeping track of what the expression string is, we will
 * also keep track of it's value along the way so that when the recursion hits the base case, we can check in O(1)O
 * (1) time if the expression's value equals the target value or not.
 *
 * The implementation would have been straightforward had it just been + and - operators involved. This is because 
 * both these operators have an equal precedence. That means that we can continue to evaluate the expression on the 
 * fly without any problems. Have a look at the following example.
 *
 *
 * So far so good. Now let us add the * operator as well and see how building the expression on the fly like this 
 * breaks.
 *
 *
 * What we mean by building the expression on the fly is that we keep track of the expression's value till now and we
 * simply consider that value as one of the two operands for our operators. As we can see from the two examples 
 * above, this would have worked had it just been + and - operators.
 *
 * But, this approach is bound to fail because the * operator takes precedence over + and -. The * operator would 
 * require the actual previous operand in our expression rather than the current value of the expression. i.e. In the
 * above example, the * operator needed 2 rather than 12 to get us the correct value of 18.
 *
 *
 * How to handle this?
 *
 * The idea on how to handle this problem springs from the discussion above. We simply need to keep track of the last
 * operand in our expression and how it modified the expression's value overall so that when we consider the * 
 * operator, we can reverse the effects of the previous operand and consider it for multiplication. Let's take a look
 * at the example that was breaking before.
 *
 *
 * Now we can look at the actual implementation of this algorithm.
